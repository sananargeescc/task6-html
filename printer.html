        In computing, a printer is a peripheral machine which makes a persistent representation of graphics or text, usually on paper.[1] While most output is human-readable, bar code printers are an example of an expanded use for printers.[2] Different types of printers include 3D printers, inkjet printers, laser printers, and thermal printers.[3]
        The first patented printing mechanism for applying a marking medium to a recording medium or more particularly an electrostatic inking apparatus and a method for electrostatically depositing ink on controlled areas of a receiving medium, was in 1962 by C. R. Winston, Teletype Corporation, using continuous inkjet printing. The ink was a red stamp-pad ink manufactured by Phillips Process Company of Rochester, NY under the name Clear Print. This patent (US3060429) led to the Teletype Inktronic Printer product delivered to customers in late 1966.[5]

        The first compact, lightweight digital printer was the EP-101, invented by Japanese company Epson and released in 1968, according to Epson.[6][7][8]
